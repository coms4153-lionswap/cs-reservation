LionSwap - University Student Marketplace

Description

LionSwap is a Columbia-exclusive second-hand marketplace designed to help students conveniently buy and sell unwanted items within a trusted community. By requiring login through Columbia LionMail via OAuth, the platform ensures that all users are verified students, creating a safe and reliable environment for peer-to-peer transactions. Sellers can easily list items by uploading photos, adding detailed descriptions, specifying item conditions, and setting prices. Buyers can browse listings, communicate directly with sellers through an integrated chat feature, and place refundable deposits via Venmo to reserve items before pickup. To enhance reliability and trust, buyers can leave comments on products and seller profiles, and sellers can leave feedback and rate buyers based on communication and follow-through; together, these interactions generate a transparent review history and an average credibility score for each user. 

Rather than relying on shipping, LionSwap encourages face-to-face exchanges—allowing buyers and sellers to coordinate meet-up times and locations on campus. The marketplace also supports keyword-based search and customizable filters by listing date, price range, and item condition, making it easier for students to discover exactly what they need. By combining security, convenience, and social interaction, LionSwap fosters a sustainable, student-centered circular economy where unused items find new value and every transaction contributes to a stronger campus community.
